## Tasks and inputs

Up to now, we have used a variety of different functions designed by other developers. Sometimes we need to execute an operation multiple times, and most often it is reasonable to write a function to do so. Whenever you have copied and pasted a block of code more than twice, you should consider writing a function [@wickham2017]. 

We have violated this rule multiple times when calculating the Euclidean distances between points. Writing and rewriting the code `sqrt((x-lead(x,1))^2+(y-lead(y,1))^2)` over and over again is not only cumbersome, it is also error prone. We can easily wrap this operation into a function. This input on writing functions should bring you up to speed to do this in your first task.

The first step in writing a function, is picking a name and assigning `<- function(){}` to it.

```{r}
#| echo: true

testfun <- function() {}
```

To run the function, we have to call the assigned name with the brackets. This function gives no output, which is why we get `NULL` back. 
```{r}
#| echo: true

testfun()

class(testfun)
```

To make the function actually *do* something, we need to specify *what* should be done within the curly brackets `{}`. The following function always prints the same statement and accepts no input values:

```{r}
#| echo: true

testfun <- function() {
    print("this function does nothing")
}

testfun()
```

If we want the function to accept some input values, we have to define them within the round brackets. For example, I specify a variable named `sometext` and can call this variable within the execution.

```{r}
#| echo: true

testfun <- function(sometext) {
    print(sometext)
}

testfun(sometext = "this function does slightly more, but still not much")
```



:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}

```{r}
testfun <- function(sometext) {
    print(sometext)
}
```

Note that since R Version 4.1, the above syntax can also be written as follows:

```{r}
testfun <- \(sometext){
    print(sometext)
}
```

or even more compact:

```{r}
testfun <- \(sometext) print(sometext)
```

Let's take a more practical example. Say we want a function that calculates our age if provided with the date of our birthday. We can use `Sys.time()` to provide today's date and `difftime()` to calculate the time difference between today and our birthday.

```{r}
#| echo: true

my_age <- function(birthday, units) {
    difftime(Sys.time(), birthday, units = units)
}

my_age(birthday = "1997-04-23", units = "days")
```

As we already know from using other functions, if we declare our variables in the order that we initially listed them, we do not need to specify the parameters (no need of `birthday = ` and `units =`).
```{r}
#| echo: true

my_age("1997-04-23", "days")
```

If we want any of our parameters to have default value, we can assign an initial value to the parameter when declaring the variables within the round brackets.
```{r}
#| echo: true

my_age <- function(birthday, units = "days") {
    difftime(Sys.time(), birthday, units = units)
}

# if not stated otherwise, our function uses the unit "days"
my_age("1997-04-23")

# We can still overwrite units
my_age("1997-04-23", "hours")
```

All you need to do now is run execute the function deceleration (`myage <- function...` etc.) at the beginning of your script, and you can use the function for your entire R session.

Always try to make your function self sufficient: Only use objects within your function that are either passed as function arguments or created within the funtion. See more on this topic [here](https://raps-with-r.dev/fprog.html#referentially-transparent-and-pure-functions), in the online version of the book by @rodrigues2023.

### Task 1: Write your own functions

Create a function for our Euclidean distance calculation. 

Note: if you treat your input variables as vectors, they will work in `dplyr`s `mutate()` and `summarise()` operations. 

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week4/task_1.R"
#| echo: false
#| include: false

```

### Task 2: Prepare Analysis

In the next tasks we will look for "meet" patterns in our wildboar data. To simplify this, we will only use a subset of our wildboar data: The individuals *Rosa* and *Sabi* for the timespan *01.04.2015 - 15.04.2015*. You can download the dataset here [wildschwein_BE_2056.csv](https://moodle.zhaw.ch/pluginfile.php/1168373/mod_folder/content/0/wildschwein_BE_2056.csv?forcedownload=1) and filter it with the aforementioned criteria. 

Remember to load the necessary libraries first! We propose the following:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| results: "hide"

library("readr")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("lubridate")
```

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week4/task_2.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 3: Create Join Key

Have a look at your dataset. You will notice that samples are taken at every full hour, quarter past, half past and quarter to. The sampling time is usually off by a couple of seconds. 

To compare Rosa and Sabi's locations, we first need to match the two animals *temporally*. For that we can use a `join`, but need *identical* time stamps to serve as a join key. We therefore need to slightly adjust our time stamps to a common, concurrent interval. 

The task is therfore to round the minutes of `DatetimeUTC` to a multiple of 15 (00, 15, 30,45) and store the values in a new column[^interpolate]. You can use the  `lubridate` function `round_date()` for this. See the examples [here](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/reference/round_date.html) to see how this goes.

[^interpolate]: *Please note:* We are manipulating our time stamps without adjusting the x,y-coordinates. This is fine for our simple example, but we would advice against this in a more serious research endeavour, e.g. in your semester projects. One simple approach would be to linearly interpolate the positions to the new timestamps. If you choose Option A the wild boar projects as your semester projects, you should aim for a linear interpolation. Get in touch if you need help with this.

Your new dataset should look something like this (note the additional column): 

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week4/task_3.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 4: Measuring distance at concurrent locations

To measure the distance between concurrent locations, we need to follow the following steps.

1. Split the `wildschwein_filter` object into one `data.frame` per animal
2. Join\* these datasets by the new `Datetime` column created in the last task. The joined observations are *temporally close*.
3. In the joined dataset, calculate Euclidean distances between concurrent observations and store the values in a new column
4. Use a reasonable threshold on `distance` to determine if the animals are also *spatially close* enough to constitute a *meet* (we use 100 meters). Store this Boolean information (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) in a new column

\* We recommend using one `dplyr`s join methods (`inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()` or `full_join()`), which one is appropriate? Tip: specify `suffix` to prevent column names ending in `.x` or `.y`.

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week4/task_4.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 5: Visualize data

Now, visualize the *meets* spatially in a way that you think reasonable. For example in the plot as shows below. To produce this plot we:

- Used the individual dataframes from `rosa` and `sabi` (from the previous task)
- Used the joined dataset (also from the previous task), filtered to only the meets
- Manually changed the x and y axis limits

```{r}
#| file: "solutions/week4/task_5.R"
#| echo: false

```

### Task 6 (optional): Visualize data as timecube with `plotly`

Finally, you can nicely visualize the meeting patterns and trajectories in a Space-Time-Cube [@hagerstraand1970] with the package `plotly`. There are some [nice ressources](https://plot.ly/r/3d-line-plots/) available online.
